# Menu Management & Item Database Use Cases

Below are the main use cases for relating to the first two requirements of the system, the API and its web interface.

## There will be an API, providing access to all features - Requirement #1

- As a developer, I want the menu to be stored in a central location, so that items are not copied throughout a dozen modules.
- As the manager, I want the menu to be stored in a central location, so that customers can get a consistent experience.
- As a customer, I want to know the allergens/dietary requirements in things I am ordering, so that I don't eat anything that I am unable to.
